    "question": "Am I the right trainer for you?",
    "answer": "It is important to understand that having a well trained dog will likely require some lifestyle changes. I am ready to do whatever it takes for you and your dog to be successful, as long as I know you are ready to make the same commitment to me and your dog. I will reward your dog, but I will also correct unwanted behavior. "

  {
    "question": "Are you the right client for me?",
    "answer": "I am looking for clients who are going to follow through on their homework. Your follow through at home is imperative to the success of your dog's training. I will assign homework for you to complete while your dog is in training. Completing this homework is essential to long term success and maintaining the training they receive."

  {
    "question": "What is permisson based training?",
    "answer": "In one word, trust. Itâ€™s a training method that enables you to build a bonding relationship with your dog where the dog trusts you to help him/her make good decisions instead of reacting out of excitement or fear."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tools do you use?",
    "answer": "It is important to have a large 'tool box' when it comes to training dogs. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to dog training.  Some tools I use include: prong collars, e-collars, slip leads, Pet Convincer (compressed air for interrupting unwanted behavior), my dog, long-lines and food.  The goal of this training is to achieve the result of a calm, relaxed, tuned-in, confident, happy and obedient companion."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you tell me more about prong collars?",
    "answer": "Prong collars are the least physically taxing tool available to both you and your dog. It allows you to use very little physical effort to communicate with your dog. Many tools only mask bad behaviors, but prong collars allow us to create a different state of mind for your dog."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you tell me more about e-collars?",
    "answer": "E-collars come with a remote and are a fantastic way to communicate with your dog. It can provide off-leash freedom for your dog in certain scenarios. We use a top of the line remote e-collar system with 100 levels. This allows us to fine tune our training, so each dog is using the lowest level possible for communication."
